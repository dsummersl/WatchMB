 - watchmac - 
--------------

A simple script to capture information about your MacBook (or OSX something).
Use it to keep a historical picture book of yourself. Use it to track where
your computer is, and what is happening on it.

What it does:

1. Uses the iSight camera it creates one shapshot, which is time stamped (using
   the wacaw program). The format is: MonthDayYearHourMinuteSecond.jpeg

2. Captures a screenshot of the desktop. The format is
   MonthDayYearHourMinuteSecond-screen.jpeg

3. Stores the public IP address of the computer. The IP address is stored in a
   file labelled: MonthDayYearHourMinuteSecond-loc.txt

------------------
 - INSTALLATION - 
------------------

Put the watchmac directory somewhere on your computer (like your home
directory). Either run the script directly, or use cron to schedule regular
snapshots.

I've set mine up thusly, so that I have access to the files even if I'm not in
front of it (by going to dropbox.com):

1. Install DropBox. Create the folder 'watchmac' in the 'Photos' folder.
2. Put this program's folder into my home directory: run Terminal and paste the following:

git ...

3. Copy/paste the following commands into the Terminal window to setup the
   script to run every half hour:

crontab -l | grep -v photo.sh > oldcrontab 
(cat oldcrontab ; echo "0,30 * * * * ~/watchmac/photo.sh &> /dev/null") > newcrontab
crontab newcrontab
rm oldcrontab
rm newcrontab
